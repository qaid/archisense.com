# A Basic Replacement Page for Archisense.com

## Background

From roughly 2003 until 2013 I ran a freelance graphic design company in New York City: Archisense + APV. Later, I reduced the name down to Archisense Design. My office was wherever I lived in various apartments in Brooklyn, with a staff of 1. Occasionally I worked with contracted developers and visual artists.

The website I built to expos√© my work at [Archisense.com][1], was based on Wordpress, with a customized version of the [Striking][2] theme built by [KaptinLin][3].

In 2013 I decided to re-brand my design and development work under my own name and to sunset the business of Archisense. A bitter sweet decision, it was nonetheless strategic, and resulted in an opportunity to develop a new website using whatever approach I fancied at the time. For me, it was to move towards a static site build using an efficient framework. The results are at [QaidJacobs.com][4].

## I Love Wordpress, but ...

Wordpress is a fantastic platform and I use it often in my web dev projects, but for sites that I don't need to pay frequent attention to, Wordpress can be a burden. Since it's such a popular platform, it is frequently the object of malicious, external activity, and without an aggressive updating and patching routine, a Wordpress install is likely to fall into a vulnerable state.

Archisense.com will not be updated again (RIP!), so it didn't make sense to leave it's backend as Wordpress.

So this small project is the one-page HTML site that replaces the Wordpress install with a simple note indicating the fate of Archisense and where to go now.
